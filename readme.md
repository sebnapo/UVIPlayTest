# Coding test - Internship at UVI Play - Napoleon Sebastien - One million books

The goal is to display smoothly a list of 1.000.000 books on a website.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development only.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You will need Composer and Php already on your computer.
```

### Installing


```
Git clone the repository or download it.
```

```
Run composer install command
```

```
Take the downloaded data.json file i've sent to you and put it in the public folder 
```

```
To generate the css part, you have to run the "yarn install" commandand then run the command "yarn run encore dev"

## Acknowledgments

* Page is loading under 10 seconds
* I inspired myself with the twitter style for loading the components, not as a unique list to load entirely, but with little part of the list, loaded when user scroll down.
* Have fun while visiting my project, I hope this will fit with your expectations.
